Each player will automatically be placed in the "Ready" mode, and will be paired in a Game against another player in a Hot Streak Event, Wins Event, or Sphere Event (described below) if an Event is already in progress or when a new Event begins. If a player is not playing in a Game and is not being paired against another player by Sponsor, the player can click on the "Not Ready" button. Doing so will keep the player from being paired against an opponent until that player clicks the "Ready" button, signifying that the player is ready to join an Event. A player can click the "Cancel" button when being paired against an opponent by Sponsor, which will return the player to the Events Lobby. Before a player begins a Game, the player will be asked to select a deck to play with from the deck selection window. If the player does not select a deck, the player will be disqualified, and the player's opponent will automatically win. Each Event will last for approximately three (3) hours, will run for the time specified in the Events Calendar, and will consist of one (1) or more Games against another player. </span></p>
